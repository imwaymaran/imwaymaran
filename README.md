# Hi there, I'm Gennadii Ershov

I'm a former clinical oncologist transitioning into data science.  
I build projects that combine data, code, and impact.

## About

- Currently enrolled in the MIT Emerging Talent and Knowledge House Data Science programs  
- I like working on projects that connect data, people, and decisions 
- Especially interested in applied machine learning in fraud detection and recommendation systems

### Currently Working On

Developing a hybrid content-based recommender that uses embeddings, topic modeling, and contextual bandits to personalize mental-health videos and improve user engagement.  
*Tools: Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, KeyBERT, TF-IDF, sentence-transformers*

**Mental Health Program Evaluation (Non-Profit)**  
Analyzing data from 10K+ youth to evaluate program outcomes, design models, and create visualizations that measure changes in wellbeing and support funding decisions.  
*Tools: Python, pandas, PostgreSQL, Matplotlib, Seaborn*

**[Data Scientist Job Tracker](https://github.com/imwaymaran/data-scientist-job-tracker.git)**  
Daily scraper that collects, normalizes, and deduplicates Google job postings for “data scientist” roles in the U.S.  
*Tools: Python, pandas, SQLite, SerpApi*

## Selected Projects
