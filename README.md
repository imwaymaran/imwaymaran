# Hi there, I'm Gennadii Ershov

Former clinical oncologist transitioning into data science.  

## About

- Currently enrolled in the MIT Emerging Talent and Knowledge House Data Science programs  
- I build projects that combine data, code, and impact
- Especially interested in applied machine learning in fraud detection and recommendation systems

### Currently Working On

**Recommendation System for Mental Health App Users**  
Hybrid recommendation engine that personalizes mental-health videos using embeddings, topic modeling, and contextual bandits.
The core system is fully implemented and currently being prepared for integration into the production app.  
*Tools: Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, KeyBERT, TF-IDF, sentence-transformers*

**Mental Health Program Evaluation (Non-Profit)**  
Evaluation of wellbeing outcomes for 10K+ youth through modeling and visual analysis to support funding decisions and program improvements.
The core analysis is complete; current work focuses on preparing final documentation for the client.  
*Tools: Python, pandas, PostgreSQL, Matplotlib, Seaborn*

**[Data Scientist Job Tracker](https://github.com/imwaymaran/data-scientist-job-tracker.git)**  
Daily pipeline that collects and cleans Google Jobs postings for Data Scientist roles in NYC.
The scraping and data-engineering phase is complete; the system now runs autonomously while the dataset grows.
Once enough historical data is collected, analysis will focus on long-term hiring trends.  
*Tools: Python, SQLite, SerpApi, Cloudflare R2, GitHub Actions*

## Selected Projects

**[Youth & Legal Access: Immigration Case Analysis](https://github.com/MIT-Emerging-Talent/ET6-CDSP-group-19-repo)**  
Exploratory data analysis on 80M+ U.S. immigration cases with focus on juvenile legal representation.  
*Tools: Python, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, SciPy*

**[Mental Health Chatbot](https://github.com/imwaymaran/mh-support-chatbot)**  
Gemini-powered wellness assistant with appointment simulation, reminders, and crisis detection.  
*Tools: Python, Gemini API*

**[Suicide Ideation Detection](https://github.com/imwaymaran/suicide-ideation-detection-ml)**  
Reddit-based text classifier with a local baseline and deployment on Google Vertex AI.  
*Tools: Python, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, NLTK, TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Google Vertex AI*

**[Fraud Detection: Bank Transactions](https://github.com/imwaymaran/fraud-detection-bank-transactions/tree/main)**  
Machine learning models for identifying fraudulent banking activity.  
*Tools: Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, XGBoost*

**[Virtual Study Buddy App](https://github.com/imwaymaran/virtual-study-buddy-app)**  
A student matching tool based on availability, goals, and study habits.  
*Tools: Python, Flask, SQLite, Jinja, HTML/CSS*

**[Lecture Navigator](https://github.com/imwaymaran/lecturer-navigator)**  
LLM-powered PDF assistant for querying lecture slides with citations in a Streamlit app.  
*Tools: Python, pandas, PyPDF, FAISS, LangChain, OpenAI API, Streamlit*

**[Sentiment Analysis Pipeline](https://github.com/imwaymaran/sentiment-analysis-pipeline)**
